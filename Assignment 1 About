Assignment Objective
This assignment is designed to ensure that students understand and can effectively use dynamic memory allocation and structs in C programming. Through this task, students will learn to:

Dynamically allocate and manage memory.
Use structs to model real-world entities and organize related data.
Write modular code with clear functions for tasks such as sorting and data manipulation.
Handle and process user input systematically.
Practice good coding practices such as commenting, using clear variable names, and properly freeing allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in writing maintainable and efficient code for programs that manage dynamic data.
